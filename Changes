 - Devel::CheckLib:: assert_lib() only runs the test code when you
   supply a library name, I didn't supply a library name so it didn't
   properly check for epoll_create().  Supply a library name of "c"
   (aka libc) to placate assert_lib().

1.001_01 Mon Mar 15 20:57:48 EST 2010

 - check that epoll is actually available, it's not available for all
   Linux systems.

1.001 Sun Mar  7 13:17:17 EST 2010

 - don't mortalize the temp svs we use in tracing, we might be inside
   lp_loop_run(), and the SVs won't be released until that returns.
   Use SvREFCNT_dec() instead.

 - use the poexs time function instead of defining our own.

1.000 

 - use META_MERGE in Makefile.PL instead of the obsolete EXTRA_META
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39700

 - croak if loop methods are called when the loop hasn't been initialized
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=55063

 - treat EPOLLHUP events as read events
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=53474

 - if we notice a change in process id, assume the epoll fd has been
   cloned, close it (for this process) and reload it with the events
   we're watching.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=53474

 - removing trailing newlines from trace output to avoid doubled PIDs
   in the output

 - disable assertions which 0.001 shipped with.

0.001 Fri Aug 15 18:53:01 EST 2008
 - initial release
