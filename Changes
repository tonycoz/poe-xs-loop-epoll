This is the change history of POE::XS::Loop::EPoll.

1.001

 - don't mortalize the temp svs we use in tracing, we might be inside
   lp_loop_run(), and the SVs won't be released until that returns.
   Use SvREFCNT_dec() instead.

 - use the poexs time function instead of defining our own.

1.000 

 - use META_MERGE in Makefile.PL instead of the obsolete EXTRA_META

 - croak if loop methods are called when the loop hasn't been initialized
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=55063

 - treat EPOLLHUP events as read events
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=53474

 - if we notice a change in process id, assume the epoll fd has been
   cloned, close it (for this process) and reload it with the events
   we're watching.

 - removing trailing newlines from trace output to avoid doubled PIDs
   in the output

 - disable assertions which 0.001 shipped with.
