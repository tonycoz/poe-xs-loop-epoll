=head1 NAME

POE::XS::Loop::EPoll - an XS implementation of POE::Loop, using Linux` epoll(2).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Kernel { loop => 'POE::XS::Loop::EPoll' };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop interface
written in C using the Linux epoll(2) family of system calls.

Signals are left to POE::Loop::PerlSignals.

The epoll_ctl() call returns an error when you attempt to poll regular
files, POE::XS::Loop::EPoll emulate's poll(2)'s behaviour with regular
files under Linux - ie. they're always readable/writeable.

If you see an error:

  POE::XS::Loop::EPoll hasn't been initialized correctly

then the loop hasn't been loaded correctly, in POE <= 1.287 the
following:

  # this doesn't work
  use POE qw(XS::Loop::EPoll);

will not load the loop correctly, you will need to do:

  use POE::Kernel { loop => 'POE::XS::Loop::EPoll' };
  use POE;
